# Anti-stall and execution budget v1

## Goal

Prevent autonomous agents from becoming unbounded polling, retry, repair, or task-selection loops while preserving durable repository state.

## Acceptance

- [x] Add the normative anti-stall contract.
- [x] Require it from the automatically loaded root bootstrap.
- [x] Route local execution through it.
- [x] Limit CI checks, unchanged states, identical failures, repair cycles, context reconstruction, command duration, runtime and no-progress time.
- [ ] Pass exact-head Required workflow.
- [ ] Merge and archive.
